Klub Polaco,"Jorge Luis Borges 2076, C1425 CABA, Argentina",Verónica Serrano,5,"Great place to have a drink and get a little bit closer to Polish culture, they do have different beers and cider, they also offer Zapiekankas (polish street food) and you must try the Pierogi, these are.really good. We loved them. They have a outdoor space with a Mandarine tree that is really good for staying outside during hot days.. otherwise they do have an indoors area that is perfect for a more intimate experience. Worth visiting for chilling out and try something new.",a year ago

Klub Polaco,"Jorge Luis Borges 2076, C1425 CABA, Argentina",Einar Coutin,5,"I'm biased since I romanticize Poland... And this place has the best burger we've had in Baires, the Polski. That bum with the chives and mayo sauce..to die for. And don't forget the Wodka, like honeywater just like in Sienkiewickz books. Did I mention the ambience? Totally hip loungy place.",3 years ago

Desarmadero Bar,"Gorriti 4295, C1414 CABA, Argentina",Giulia Sampogna - Like Wanderlust,5,"This place got my attention from the first second I arrived there. Such a cool entrance. It was full, so many people drinking, talking and enjoying there time. I couldn’t find a place to seat, so we decided to seat outside (even with the rain). After our friends arrived we found a nice rooftop. We had delicious beers and of course fernet con coca (Argentinian drink). We ordered a burger and it was delicious as well. I really enjoyed this place. Hope to go again.",3 years ago
Desarmadero Bar,"Gorriti 4295, C1414 CABA, Argentina",Leonardo Sigales,5,"Amazing place in Palermo to enjoy a great Argentinean crafts. 23 different styles.

Desarmadero Bar,"Gorriti 4295, C1414 CABA, Argentina",Francisco Almeida,5,"This is one of my favorite craft beer bars in Palermo. The reason why this place is not your typical local craft beer bar is because they try (and succeed) to offer a large variety of beers and not just the normal staple of styles that most places have.

They offer Sours, NEIPA, IPA Milkshakes, etc.  and some of the breweries represented on the menu are the best breweries making beer today.

Apart from that, the place looks so cool. You just have to see it in person to take it all in properly.

The beer in this picture is a Tropical Saison by Cerveza Minga and Juguetes Perdidos Cerveza Artesanal for example. It's an excelent beer.

If you are serious about craft beer then this place should be a must for you.",3 years ago

Tolon Cafe,"Av. Santa Fe 3200, C1425 CABA, Argentina",Rebeka Hengalová,5,"Amazing café, looks great and has a calm atmosphere. We had the breakfast deal of cappuccino with fresh orange juice and three croissants each on multiple occasions and each time the coffee was flavourful and strong, the croissants still warm and crispy. The service is fast and attentive. There's good wifi and they let you sit there and work. The area is nice for a stroll. They even serve lunch sandwiches - we had the veggie and the salmon one, both tasty. Would definitely like to come back.",7 months ago
